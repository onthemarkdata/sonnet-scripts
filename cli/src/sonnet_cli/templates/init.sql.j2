-- Seed SQL for {{ project_name }}
-- This file can be used to initialize your database with sample structures

-- Create schemas for organizing your data
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS staging;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS marts;

-- Example: Create a simple sample table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS staging.sample_data (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO staging.sample_data (name, description) VALUES
    ('Sample Record 1', 'This is the first sample record'),
    ('Sample Record 2', 'This is the second sample record'),
    ('Sample Record 3', 'This is the third sample record');

-- Create a sample view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW marts.sample_summary AS
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    MIN(created_at) as first_created,
    MAX(created_at) as last_created
FROM staging.sample_data;
