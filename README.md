# Sonnet Scripts
Sonnet Scripts is a collection of pre-built data architecture patterns that you can quickly spin up on a local machine, along with examples of real-world data that you can use with it.

## Why was Sonnet Scripts created?
One of the challenges of making content and tutorials on data is the lack of established data infrastructure and real-world datasets. I have often found myself repeating this process over and over again, therefore I decided to create an open-source repo to expedite this process.

## Why sonnets?
[According to the Academy of American Poets](https://poets.org/glossary/sonnet), a "...sonnet is a fourteen-line poem written in iambic pentameter, employing one of several rhyme schemes, and adhering to a tightly structured thematic organization. Through the constraints of a particular sonnet format, poets throughout centuries have pushed their creativity to express themselves-- William Shakespear being one of the most well-known. I've similarly seen data architectures fill the same role as a sonnet, where their specific patterns push data practioners to think of creative ways to solve business problems.
